## [1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-the-parentheses/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-04)

**Intuition:**
The code aims to find the nesting depth of a given valid parentheses string (VPS). It iterates through the string, counting the opening and closing parentheses to determine the depth of nesting.

**Approach:**
1. Iterate through each character of the string.
2. If the current character is '(', increment the count of opening parentheses.
3. If the current character is ')', decrement the count of opening parentheses.
4. Update the maximum nesting depth encountered so far.
5. Return the maximum nesting depth.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because we iterate through the string once to determine the nesting depth.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) since we are using only a constant amount of extra space to store variables regardless of the size of the input string.


# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(string s) {
        int ans = 0, ctOpening = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++){
            if (s[i] == '(') ctOpening++;
            else if (s[i] == ')') ctOpening--;
            ans = max(ans,ctOpening);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

 
```
