## [930. Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-subarrays-with-sum/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-03-14)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
To efficiently count the subarrays with the desired sum, I will utilize the concept of prefix sums.
- A prefix sum of an array at index `i` represents the sum of all elements from index 0 to `i`.
- By maintaining a prefix sum, I can determine the sum of any subarray by computing the difference between two prefix sums.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Initialized the variables : `ans` to store the result, `prefix` to keep track of the prefix sum, and `count` as a HashMap to store the count of encountered prefix sums.
- Initialized the `count` HashMap with a key-value pair `(0, 1)` to indicate the prefix sum of 0 with count 1.
- Iterated through the array elements :
    - Updated the `prefix` sum by adding the current element.
    - Calculated the difference between the current prefix sum and the target value (`goal`).
    - If the HashMap contained the calculated key, added the count associated with that key to the result.
    - Updated the count of the current prefix sum in the HashMap.
- Returned the final count of subarrays with the given sum (`ans`).

My approach efficiently counted the number of subarrays with the desired sum by utilizing prefix sums and a HashMap to keep track of prefix sum occurrences.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments ... Keep Solving.:)
# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$n$ : size of the input array
- Space complexity : $O(n)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
  
  // Method to count the number of subarrays with the given sum.
  public int numSubarraysWithSum(int[] nums, int goal) {

    // Initializing variables to store the result and the prefix sum.
    int ans = 0;
    int prefix = 0;
    // Creating a HashMap to store the count of prefix sums encountered so far.
    Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
    // Adding an initial key-value pair to indicate the prefix sum of 0 with count 1.
    count.put(0, 1);

    // Iterating through the array elements.
    for (final int num : nums) {
      // Updating the prefix sum.
      prefix += num;
      // Calculating the difference between the current prefix sum and the target value.
      final int key = prefix - goal;
      // If the HashMap contains the key, add the count associated with that key to the result.
      if (count.containsKey(key))
        ans += count.get(key);
      // Updating the count of the current prefix sum in the HashMap.
      count.merge(prefix, 1, Integer::sum);
    }

    // Returning the final count of subarrays with the given sum.
    return ans;
  }
}
