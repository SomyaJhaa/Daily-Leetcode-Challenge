## 948. Bag of Tokens


# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The goal of this algorithm is to calculate the maximum score that can be obtained from a bag of tokens, given the initial power. The idea is to strategically play the tokens to maximize the score.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
**Sorting** : I sorted the array of tokens in ascending order. This allowed me to consider the smallest tokens first, making the algorithm more efficient.

**Two Pointers** : Used two pointers, `leftIndex` and `rightIndex`, initially pointing to the smallest and largest tokens, respectively.

**Token Play Loop** : Iterated through the tokens while considering the available power and the current score. Play tokens in a way to maximize the score :

   - Played the smallest face up (increment `leftIndex`) if there's enough power.
   
   - Updated the maximum score if needed.
   
   - Played the largest face down (decrement `rightIndex`) if there's still score to be used.

**Result** : The final result is the maximum score obtained from the bag of tokens.

My algorithm ensured efficient utilization of power and strategic playing of tokens to achieve the maximum possible score.x

class Solution {
    
    // Method to calculate the maximum score for a given set of tokens and initial power
    public int bagOfTokensScore(int[] tokens, int power) {
        int maxScore = 0;          // Variable to store the maximum score
        int currentScore = 0;      // Variable to track the current score
        int leftIndex = 0;         // Index of the smallest token
        int rightIndex = tokens.length - 1;  // Index of the largest token

        Arrays.sort(tokens);       // Sorting the tokens in ascending order

        // Iterating through the tokens while considering the power and score
        while (leftIndex <= rightIndex && (power >= tokens[leftIndex] || currentScore > 0)) {
            // Playing the smallest face up as long as there is enough power
            while (leftIndex <= rightIndex && power >= tokens[leftIndex]) {
                power -= tokens[leftIndex++];
                ++currentScore;
            }
            // Updating the maximum score
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, currentScore);
            
            // Playing the largest face down if there's still score to be used
            if (leftIndex <= rightIndex && currentScore > 0) {
                power += tokens[rightIndex--];
                --currentScore;
            }
        }

        // Returning the calculated maximum score
        return maxScore;
    }
