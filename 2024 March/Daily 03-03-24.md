## 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

**Intuition:**

The goal is to remove the nth node from the end of the linked list. To achieve this, we can use a two-pointer approach. We maintain two pointers, `p` and `q`, initially pointing to the dummy node. We move `q` ahead by `n` nodes. Then, while `q` is not at the end of the list, we move both `p` and `q` one node at a time. When `q` reaches the end, `p` will be pointing to the node before the one we want to remove. We then adjust the next pointers to skip the nth node.

**Approach:**

1. Create a dummy node and set both `p` and `q` pointers to the dummy node.
2. Move `q` ahead by `n` nodes.
3. Move both `p` and `q` one node at a time until `q` reaches the end of the list.
4. Adjust the next pointers to skip the nth node.
5. Delete the temporary node and return the modified linked list.

**Time Complexity:**

The algorithm makes a single pass through the linked list, so the time complexity is O(sz), where sz is the number of nodes in the list.

**Space Complexity:**

The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, except for the dummy node, so the space complexity is O(1).


# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(s)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$s$ : number of nodes in the list
- Space complexity : $O(1)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

        dummy -> next = head;
        ListNode *p = dummy, *q = dummy;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
            q = q -> next;

        while(q -> next != nullptr)
        p = p -> next, q = q -> next;

        ListNode* temp = p -> next;
        p -> next = p -> next -> next;
        delete(temp);

        return dummy -> next;
    }
};
