## 3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
- I will utilize a HashMap to efficiently store and update the frequency of each element in the input array.

- Keep track of the maximum frequency encountered during the traversal.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- I initialized a HashMap (m) to store the frequency of each element and a variable (max) to track the maximum frequency.

- Traversed through the input array (nums) :
  - For each element, updated its frequency in the HashMap.
  - Updated the maximum frequency (max) if a higher frequency is encountered.

- Iterated through the keys of the HashMap :
  - For each key, if its frequency is equal to the maximum frequency (max), added its frequency to the final answer (jawab).

- The final result (jawab) is the sum of frequencies of elements with the maximum frequency.

My approach efficiently identified elements with the maximum frequency in the given array.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments ... Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(N)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$N$ : number of elements in the input array `nums`
$u$ : number of unique elements in the input array `nums`
- Space complexity : $O(u)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
 
    // Method to find the maximum frequency elements in an array
    public int maxFrequencyElements(int[] nums) {
       // HashMap to store the frequency of each element
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> m = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Variable to track the maximum frequency
        int max = 0;
        
        // Looping through the array to count the frequency of each element
        for (int i : nums) {
            // If the element is not present in the HashMap, adding it with a default frequency of 0
            m.putIfAbsent(i, 0);
            
            // Updating the frequency of the element in the HashMap
            m.put(i, m.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
            
            // Updating the maximum frequency
            max = Math.max(max, m.get(i));
        }   

        // Variable to store the final answer
        int jawab = 0;
        
        // Looping through the keys of the HashMap to find elements with the maximum frequency
        for (int k : m.keySet()) {
            // If the frequency of the element is equal to the maximum frequency, adding it to the answer
            if (m.get(k) == max) {
                jawab += m.get(k);
            }
        }
        
        // Returning the final answer
        return jawab;
    }
}
