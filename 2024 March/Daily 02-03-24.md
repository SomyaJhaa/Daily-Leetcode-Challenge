## 977. Squares of a Sorted Array

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
- The idea is to square the elements of the sorted array in a way that the resulting array is also sorted.
- The algorithm uses two pointers, one starting from the beginning (left) and the other starting from the end (right) of the input array.
- The pointer that points to the element with a larger absolute value gets squared and placed in the result array in reverse order.


# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

- Initialize two pointers, left and right, at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
- Iterate from the end of the result array to the beginning, filling it with squared values.
- Compare the absolute values of elements pointed by left and right.
- Take the square of the element with a larger absolute value and move the corresponding pointer accordingly.
- Continue until all elements of the result array are filled.

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(s)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$s$ : length of the input string
- Space complexity : $O(s)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(), left = 0, right = n-1;
        vector<int> ans(n);
        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int val;
            if (abs(nums[left]) < abs(nums[right])) {
                val = nums[right];
                right--;
            }
            else {
                val = nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            ans[i] = val * val;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

```
