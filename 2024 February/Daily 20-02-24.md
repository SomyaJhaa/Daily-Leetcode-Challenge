## [268. Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-20)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The given task is to find the missing number in an array.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Cumulative Sum Calculation :
  - A cumulative sum (`jor`) is maintained to keep track of the sum of elements in the array. This sum is calculated by iterating through each element in the array and adding it to the cumulative sum.

- Expected Sum Calculation :
  - The expected sum (`supposedSum`) is calculated based on the assumption that the array contains all numbers from 0 to `nums.length`. The formula used is `(nums.length * (nums.length + 1)) / 2`, representing the sum of an arithmetic series.

- Finding the Missing Number :
  - The missing number is determined by subtracting the cumulative sum (`jor`) from the expected sum (`supposedSum`). The result is then returned as the missing number in the array.

My approach leverages the concept of arithmetic series to efficiently identify the missing element in the array.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments ... Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$n$ : length of the input array `nums`
- Space complexity : $O(1)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    
    // Static variable to store the cumulative sum
    static int jor;

    // Method to find the missing number in the array
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        // Initializing the cumulative sum to 0
        jor = 0;

        // Calculating the cumulative sum of the array elements
        for (int i : nums) {
            jor += i;
        }

        // Calculating the expected sum of all numbers from 0 to nums.length
        int supposedSum = (nums.length * (nums.length + 1)) / 2;

        // Returning the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum
        return supposedSum - jor;
    }
}
```
