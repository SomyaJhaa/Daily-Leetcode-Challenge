# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The goal was to find the maximum number of cherries that two robots can collect while starting from the top row and moving towards the bottom row in a grid.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
**Initialized the Memoization Array (`m`) :**
- Created a 3D memoization array to store intermediate results.
- The memoization array was used to avoid redundant calculations during recursive calls.

**Recursive Cherry-Picking :**
- Defined a recursive function (`cherryPick`) to explore all possible paths of both robots.
- Base Cases :
  - If the current row is at the bottom of the grid, returned 0.
  - If either robot goes out of bounds, returned 0.
  - If the result for the current state is already memoized, returned the memoized value.
- Calculated the cherries collected in the current row based on the positions of both robots.
- Recursively explored all the possible movements for both robots in the next row.
- Updated the memoization array with the maximum cherries collected for the current state.

**Started the Recursive Process :**
- Called the recursive function with the initial positions of both robots at the top row.

**Returned the Maximum Cherries :**
- The final result is the maximum cherries that can be collected by both robots.

My approach used recursion with memoization to explore all possible paths of the two robots, considering their movements in the grid. The memoization array helped optimizing the algorithm by avoiding redundant calculations and improving overall efficiency. The final result represented the maximum cherries that can be collected by both robots.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(9^m)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$m$ : number of rows

$n$ : number of columns
- Space complexity : $O(m * n^2).$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

        // Filling the memoization array with -1
        for (int[][] a : m){
            Arrays.stream(a).forEach(b -> Arrays.fill(b, -1));
        }

        // Starting the recursive cherry-picking process from the top row and both robots
        return cherryPick(grid, 0, 0, grid[0].length - 1);
    }

    // Recursive helper function to find the maximum cherries collected
    private int cherryPick(int[][] grid, int x, int y1, int y2) {

          return 0;
        }

        // Checking if the result is already memoized
        if (m[x][y1][y2] != -1){
          return m[x][y1][y2];
        }

        // Collecting cherries in the current row
        int r = grid[x][y1] + (y1 == y2 ? 0 : grid[x][y2]);

          for (int v = -1; v <= 1; v++){
            // Updating the memoization array with the maximum cherries
            m[x][y1][y2] = Math.max(m[x][y1][y2], r + cherryPick(grid, x + 1, y1 + u, y2 + v));
          }
        }
