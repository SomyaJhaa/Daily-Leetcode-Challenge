## [2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-palindromic-string-in-the-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-13)

**Intuition:**
The given problem requires finding the first palindromic string in an array of strings. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

**Approach:**
The code iterates through each string in the input array and checks if it is a palindrome or not. It uses a nested loop to compare characters from the start and end of the string until the middle. If at any point, characters are not equal, it sets a flag indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If the flag remains 0 after the inner loop, it means the string is a palindrome, and the function returns it. If no palindrome is found, an empty string is returned.

**Time Complexity:**
Let `n` be the length of the longest string in the array and `m` be the number of strings in the array. The time complexity is O(m * n) because for each string, we are iterating over half of its characters to check for a palindrome.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) because the code uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size. It only uses a few integer variables (`flag`, `n`, `i`, `j`) for looping and comparison.


# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    string firstPalindrome(vector<string>& words) {
        for(int i = 0 ; i < words.size() ; i++)
        {
            int flag = 0;
            int n = words[i].size();
            for(int j = 0 ; j < n/2 ; j++)
            {
                if(words[i][j] != words[i][n-j-1])
                {
                    flag = 1;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(flag == 0)
                return words[i];
                
        }
        return "";
    }
};

```
