## [647. Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/description/)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The task was to find and count palindromic substrings in a given string. A palindromic substring is one that reads the same backward as forward.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
**Initialized the Count Variable :** Started with a count variable to keep track of the total number of palindromic substrings.

**Looped Through Characters :**
- Iterated through each character in the string.

**Considered Two Cases :**
  - **Case 1 :** Palindromic substrings with odd length.
    - Visualization :  Place both index fingers at position 'i' and expand them outward, checking for palindromes.
   - **Case 2:** Palindromic substrings with even length.
     - Visualization : Place the left index finger at position 'i' and the right index finger at 'i+1', then expand them outward, checking for palindromes.

**Implemented the Helper Function :**
- Created a helper function to check and count palindromic substrings expanding from the given indices.

**While Loop for Expansion :**
- Inside the helper function, used a while loop to continue expanding the indices until the string ends or the index fingers reach different characters.

**Incremented the Count :**
- Incremented the count for each valid palindromic substring found.

**Returned the Final Count :**
- Returned the final count as the result.

My approach efficiently counted all palindromic substrings by expanding around each character in the string. My checking function ensured that all possible palindromic substrings are considered.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(l^2)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
l :  length of the input string.
- Space complexity : $O(l)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    // Function to count palindromic substrings in the given string
    public static int countSubstrings(String s) {
        int count = 0;

        // Looping through each character in the string
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            // Counting palindromic substrings with odd length
            count += checksides(i, i, s); // Visualization : Place both index fingers at position 'i' and expand them outward

            // Counting palindromic substrings with even length
            count += checksides(i, i + 1, s); // Visualization : Place left index finger at position 'i' and right index finger at 'i+1', then expand them outward
        }

        return count;
    }

    // Function to check and count palindromic substrings expanding from the given indices
    static int checksides(int left, int right, String s) {
        int c = 0;

        // Keep incrementing until the string ends or index fingers reach different characters
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            c++;
            left--;
            right++;
        }

        return c; // Returning the count of palindromic substrings
    }
}
```
