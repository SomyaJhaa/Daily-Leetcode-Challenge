## 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
- The goal of this problem is to calculate the bitwise AND of all the numbers in the given range [left, right].

- Bitwise AND operation results in 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1. As we move from left to right in a binary representation of numbers, the common prefix of all numbers contributes to the result. Any differing bits will result in a 0 after the AND operation.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Initialized a variable `rs` (right shift) to 0 to keep track of the number of right shifts needed.
- Used a loop to continue right-shifting both `left` and `right` until they become equal.
- In each iteration, right shifted both `left` and `right` by 1 bit and incremented the `rs` counter.
- After the loop, performed a left shift on the final value of `left` by the count of right shifts (`rs`).
- Returned the result.

My idea was to identify the common prefix of all numbers in the range by iteratively right-shifting until `left` and `right` become equal. The count of right shifts is then used to left shift the common prefix to obtain the final result.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments ... Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(logN)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$N$ :  maximum value between `left` and `right`
- Space complexity : $O(1)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {

    // Method to perform bitwise AND operation on a range of numbers
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
   
        // Initializing a variable to track the number of right shifts
        int rs = 0;

        // Continuing the loop until left and right become equal
        while (left != right) {
            // Right shifting both left and right by 1 bit
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            // Incrementing the count of right shifts
            rs++;
        }

        // Performing left shift on the final value of 'left' by the count of right shifts
        return left << rs;
    }
}
```
