## [513. Find Bottom Left Tree Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-bottom-left-tree-value/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-28)

**Intuition:**

The code uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the binary tree and find the leftmost value in the last row. It maintains two variables, `maxDepth` and `bottomLeftValue`. The `maxDepth` keeps track of the maximum depth reached during the traversal, and `bottomLeftValue` stores the value of the leftmost node at the maximum depth.

The DFS function is recursive and is called on each node of the tree. It updates `maxDepth` and `bottomLeftValue` based on the depth of the current node and its value.

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the code is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the DFS function visits each node once, and the work done within the function for each node is constant.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. This is because the recursion depth during the DFS traversal is equal to the height of the tree. In the worst case, where the tree is skewed, the height H can be equal to N (number of nodes), leading to O(N) space complexity. In a balanced tree, the height H is O(log N).

 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth;
    int bottomLeftValue;

    void dfs(TreeNode* node, int depth) {
        if (node == nullptr) return;

        if (depth > maxDepth) {
            maxDepth = depth;
            bottomLeftValue = node -> val;
        }
        dfs(node -> left, depth + 1);
        dfs(node -> right, depth + 1);
    }
    int findBottomLeftValue(TreeNode* root) {
        maxDepth = -1;
        bottomLeftValue = 0;
        dfs(root,0);
        return bottomLeftValue;
    }
};
