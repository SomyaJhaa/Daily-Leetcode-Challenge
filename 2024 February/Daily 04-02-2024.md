## [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-04)

**Intuition:**
The code aims to find the minimum window substring of string `s` that contains all the characters of string `t`. It uses a sliding window approach with two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate through the characters of `s`. The `counter` variable keeps track of the number of characters in `t` that are yet to be included in the current window.

**Approach:**
1. Create a hashmap `tmp` to store the frequency of characters in string `t`.
2. Initialize pointers `i` and `j` to the beginning of the string `s`, `counter` to the length of string `t`, and `minStart` and `minLen` to track the minimum window substring.
3. Move the right pointer `j` to the right until all characters in `t` are included in the window. Update the `tmp` hashmap accordingly.
4. Once all characters are included, move the left pointer `i` to minimize the window size while still including all characters from `t`.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the right pointer `j` reaches the end of string `s`.
6. Return the minimum window substring found, or an empty string if no such substring is found.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(m + n), where m is the length of string `s` and n is the length of string `t`. Both pointers, `i` and `j`, traverse each character of `s` once.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of string `t`. This is due to the hashmap `tmp` storing the frequency of characters in `t`.



# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    string minWindow(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, int> tmp;
        for(auto c : t) tmp[c]++;
        int i = 0, j =0, counter = t.size(), minStart = 0, minLen = INT_MAX;
        int n = s.size();

        while(j < n) {
            if(tmp[s[j]] > 0)
              counter--;
              tmp[s[j]]--;
              j++;

              while(counter == 0) {
                  if(j-i <minLen) {
                      minStart = i;
                      minLen = j - i;
                  }
                  tmp[s[i]]++;
                  if(tmp[s[i]] > 0) 
                  counter++;
                  i++;
            }
        }
        return (minLen != INT_MAX ? s.substr(minStart, minLen) : "");
    }
};
