## [368. Largest Divisible Subset](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-divisible-subset/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-02-09)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
This problem aimed to find the largest divisible subset from a given array of integers. A divisible subset is a set of integers where every pair `(nums[i], nums[j])` satisfies `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` or `nums[j] % nums[i] == 0`. The goal is to return the largest possible subset.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
**Sort** : Sorted the given array `nums` in ascending order. Sorting helped in efficiently checking divisibility relationships between elements.

**Dynamic Programming** :
- Initialized three arrays :
    - `khtm`: Array to store the length of the divisible subset ending at each index.
    - `pichla`: Array to store the index of the previous element in the divisible subset.
    - `jawab`: ArrayList to store the result, i.e., the largest divisible subset.

- Initialized all elements of `khtm` to 1, as the minimum length of a subset is 1.
- Initialized all elements of `pichla` to -1, indicating no previous element initially.
- Used a nested loop to iterate through each pair of elements and updated `khtm` and `pichla` based on the divisibility relationship.

**Identified Maximum Length** :
- Kept track of the maximum length `sbsebra` and its corresponding index `in` during the dynamic programming phase.

**Reconstructed Subset** :
- Reconstructed the largest divisible subset using the information stored in the `pichla` array.

**Returned the Result** :
- Returned the final result, i.e., the largest divisible subset.

My dynamic programming approach efficiently identified the length of the largest divisible subset ending at each index and used this information to reconstruct the subset.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(n log n + n^2)$ $\equiv$  $O(n^2)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$n$ : length of the input array nums
- Space complexity : $O(n)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {

    // Static variables to store the result, lengths, and previous index of the largest divisible subset
    static ArrayList<Integer> jawab;
    static int[] khtm;
    static int[] pichla;

    // Main function to find the largest divisible subset
    public List<Integer> largestDivisibleSubset(int[] nums) {
        // Sorting the array in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // Initializing the result arraylist and length arrays
        jawab = new ArrayList<>();
        khtm = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(khtm, 1);           // Initializing all lengths to 1
        pichla = new int[nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(pichla, -1);        // Initializing all previous indices to -1

        // Variables to keep track of the maximum length and its corresponding index
        int sbsebra = 0;
        int in = -1;

        // Dynamic programming approach to find the largest divisible subset
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                // If the current number is divisible by the previous number
                // and adding it forms a larger subset, updating the length and previous index
                if (nums[i] % nums[j] == 0 && khtm[i] < 1 + khtm[j]) {
                    khtm[i] = 1 + khtm[j];
                    pichla[i] = j;
                }
            }
            // Updating the maximum length and its corresponding index
            if (sbsebra < khtm[i]) {
                sbsebra = khtm[i];
                in = i;
            }
        }

        // Reconstructing the subset using the previous index information
        while (in != -1) {
            jawab.add(nums[in]);
            in = pichla[in];
        }

        // Returning the result
        return jawab;
    }
}
