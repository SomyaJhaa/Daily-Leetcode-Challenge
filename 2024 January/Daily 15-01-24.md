## [2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-players-with-zero-or-one-losses/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-15)

**Intuition:**

The provided code aims to find two lists of players based on the given matches:
1. List of players who have not lost any matches (`notLost`).
2. List of players who have lost exactly one match (`lostone`).

The algorithm utilizes `unordered_map<int, int>` to keep track of the count of losses for each player and `set<int>` to store the winners. After processing the matches, it iterates over the winners to find players who have not lost any matches and over the losers to find players who have lost exactly one match. The final result is stored in a vector of vectors, where the first vector represents players who have not lost any matches and the second vector represents players who have lost exactly one match.

**Approach:**

The goal of the algorithm is to process a list of matches and determine two lists of players:
1. The list of players who have not lost any matches (`notLost`).
2. The list of players who have lost exactly one match (`lostone`).

The algorithm uses an `unordered_map<int, int>` called `loser` to track the count of losses for each player and a `set<int>` called `winner` to store the distinct winners. After processing the matches, it iterates over the winners to find players who have not lost any matches and over the losers to find players who have lost exactly one match. The final result is stored in a vector of vectors, where the first vector represents players who have not lost any matches, and the second vector represents players who have lost exactly one match.

**Time Complexity:**
- Iterating over the `matches` vector takes O(N) time, where N is the number of matches.
- Iterating over the `winner` set takes O(K) time, where K is the number of distinct winners.
- Iterating over the `loser` map takes O(M) time, where M is the number of distinct losers.

The overall time complexity is O(N + K + M), where N is the number of matches, K is the number of distinct winners, and M is the number of distinct losers.

**Space Complexity:**
- The `loser` map and `winner` set store information about the players, which takes O(K + M) space, where K is the number of distinct winners and M is the number of distinct losers.
- The `notLost` and `lostone` vectors store the final results, which take O(K + M) space.

The overall space complexity is O(K + M), where K is the number of distinct winners, and M is the number of distinct losers.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findWinners(vector<vector<int>>& matches) {
        unordered_map<int , int> loser;
        set<int> winner;

        for(auto r : matches){
            winner.insert(r[0]);

            loser.emplace(r[1], 0);

            // Increment count
            loser[r[1]]++;                    
        }
        vector<int> notLost;
        vector<int> lostone;

        for (int w : winner){
            if (loser.find(w) == loser.end()){
                notLost.push_back(w);
            }
        }
             for (const auto& entry : loser) {
                int lo = entry.first;
                if (entry.second == 1) {
                    lostone.push_back(lo);
                }
            }
            vector<vector<int>> ans;
            sort(notLost.begin(), notLost.end());
            sort(lostone.begin(), lostone.end());
            ans.push_back(notLost);
            ans.push_back(lostone);
        return ans;
