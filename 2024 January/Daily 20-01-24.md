## [907. Sum of Subarray Minimums](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-20)


**Intuition:**

The problem asks for the sum of the minimum element in each subarray of the given array. To efficiently calculate this, we can use a stack-based approach to find the number of elements greater than or equal to the current element to the left and right of each element. This will help us calculate the contribution of each element to the final sum.

**Approach:**

1. Create two arrays `left` and `right` of size `n` to store the count of elements greater than or equal to the current element to the left and right, respectively.

2. Use two stacks, `sLeft` and `sRight`, to keep track of elements and their counts while traversing the array from left to right and right to left, respectively.

3. For the left array (`left`), iterate through the array from left to right. For each element, pop elements from `sLeft` until the stack is empty or the top element is less than the current element. Count the number of popped elements and update the count in the `left` array for the corresponding index.

4. For the right array (`right`), iterate through the array from right to left. For each element, pop elements from `sRight` until the stack is empty or the top element is less than or equal to the current element. Count the number of popped elements and update the count in the `right` array for the corresponding index.

5. Initialize a variable `ans` to 0. Iterate through the array, and for each element, calculate its contribution to the final sum using the formula `(arr[i] * (long long)(left[i] * right[i]) % mod)`. Add this contribution to the `ans` variable.

6. Return the final answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Explanation:**

The algorithm uses two stacks (`sLeft` and `sRight`) to efficiently calculate the count of elements greater than or equal to the current element on the left and right sides, respectively. By maintaining these counts, we can determine the contribution of each element to the final sum. The use of modulo ensures that the result does not exceed the specified limit.

The final answer is obtained by summing the contributions of each element in the array. The algorithm provides an efficient solution to the problem, leveraging the stack data structure for optimal computation of counts.


**Time Complexity:**
- The algorithm uses a single pass through the input array to calculate the `left` and `right` arrays, resulting in a time complexity of O(N), where N is the size of the input array.

**Space Complexity:**
- The algorithm uses additional space to store the `left` and `right` arrays, each of size N, resulting in a space complexity of O(N).
- The two stacks (`sLeft` and `sRight`) also contribute to the space complexity, but the maximum space occupied by the stacks is O(N) collectively.
- Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(N).

public:
    int sumSubarrayMins(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> left(n,0) , right(n, 0);
        stack<pair<int, int>> sLeft, sRight;

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int cnt = 1;
            while(!sLeft.empty() && sLeft.top().first > arr[i]){
                cnt += sLeft.top().second;
                sLeft.pop();
            }
            sLeft.push({arr[i], cnt});
            left[i] = cnt;
        }
        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
            int cnt = 1;
            while(!sRight.empty() && sRight.top().first >= arr[i]){
                cnt += sRight.top().second;
                sRight.pop();
            }
            sRight.push({arr[i], cnt});
            right[i] = cnt;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            ans = (ans + (arr[i] * (long long)(left[i] * right[i])%mod)%mod)%mod;
        }
        return ans;
    }
