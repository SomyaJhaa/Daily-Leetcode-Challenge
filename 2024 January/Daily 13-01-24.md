## [1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-13)


**Intuition:**

The goal of the code is to find the minimum number of steps needed to make two given strings, `s` and `t`, anagrams of each other. To achieve this, the code uses a frequency map to keep track of the occurrences of each character in the strings. The idea is to count how many characters need to be added or removed to make the frequencies of characters in both strings equal.

**Approach:**

1. **Initialize a frequency map (`freq`):** Declare an unordered map to store the frequency of each character. The keys are characters, and the values are the difference between the frequency of the character in `s` and `t`. Initialize each character's frequency to 0.

2. **Update frequency map in the first loop:**
   - Iterate through each character in both strings simultaneously (assuming the strings have the same length).
   - Increment the frequency of the current character in `s`.
   - Decrement the frequency of the current character in `t`.

3. **Calculate minimum steps:**
   - Initialize a variable `ans` to 0. This variable will represent the minimum number of steps.
   - Iterate through the frequency map.
   - For each character, if its frequency is greater than 0, it means there are more occurrences of this character in `s` than in `t`. Add the frequency difference to `ans`.

4. **Return the result:**
   - The final result is stored in the `ans` variable, representing the minimum number of steps needed to make the two strings anagrams.

**Explanation:**

The approach leverages the fact that if two strings are anagrams, they should have the same frequency of characters. By counting the frequency difference between the two strings, the code identifies the characters that need to be added or removed to make the frequencies equal. The unordered map is used for efficient tracking of character frequencies, and the overall time and space complexity of the code is optimized.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the code is O(N), where N is the length of the input strings `s` and `t`. The code iterates through the strings once in the first loop (where N is the length of the strings), and then it iterates through the frequency map, which can have at most 26 entries (for the 26 lowercase English letters). Both of these loops have a linear time complexity, making the overall time complexity linear.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the code is O(1) because the space used is not directly proportional to the input size. The frequency map `freq` has a constant number of entries (26 for English lowercase letters), regardless of the length of the input strings. Therefore, the space complexity is constant, and it can be considered O(1).

**In summary:**
- *Time Complexity:* O(N)
- *Space Complexity:* O(1)



# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char , int> freq;

        for(int i= 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            freq[s[i]]++;
            freq[t[i]]--;
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for(auto p : freq) {
            if(p.second > 0) ans += p.second;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
