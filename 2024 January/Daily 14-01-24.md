## [1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-14)


## Intuition:

The intuition behind the code is to determine whether two strings are considered close based on the given operations. Two strings are considered close if they can be transformed into each other using swap and character transformation operations.

## Approach:

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Calculate the frequency of each character in both `word1` and `word2`.
   - Update presence arrays to keep track of whether each character is present in both words.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Sort the frequency arrays for both words.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Check if the sorted frequency arrays and presence arrays are equal for both words.

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input strings. This is because the code iterates through each character in both words once, and the sorting step has a constant time complexity.

## Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) because there are only 26 letters in the English alphabet. The size of the frequency arrays and presence arrays is constant, making the space complexity independent of the input size.



# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool closeStrings(string word1, string word2) {
        vector<int> word1_fr(26,0), word2_fr(26,0);
        vector<bool> word1_present(26,false), word2_present(26,false);

        for(char c: word1)
           word1_fr[c - 'a']++, word1_present[c - 'a'] = true;

        for(char c: word2)
           word2_fr[c - 'a']++, word2_present[c - 'a'] = true;

        sort(begin(word1_fr), end(word1_fr));
        sort(begin(word2_fr), end(word2_fr));

        return word1_fr == word2_fr && word1_present == word2_present;       
    }
};
