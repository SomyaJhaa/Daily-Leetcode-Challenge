## [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-30)


**Intuition:**

The given code implements the evaluation of a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expression using a stack. The RPN expression is provided in the form of an array of strings, where each string represents either an operand or an operator. The code iterates through the tokens, performs the necessary operations, and updates the stack accordingly until the final result is obtained.

**Approach:**

1. Initialize a stack to keep track of operands during the evaluation process.
2. Iterate through each token in the input array.
3. If the token is an operand, convert it to an integer and push it onto the stack.
4. If the token is an operator ('+', '-', '*', '/'), pop the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
5. After processing all tokens, the final result will be at the top of the stack. Return this result.

**Time Complexity:**

Let n be the number of tokens in the input array.

- The code iterates through each token once, performing constant-time operations for each token.
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is determined by the space required for the stack to store intermediate results.

- In the worst case, the stack may store all the operands before performing any operations, leading to a space complexity of O(n).
- The space required for the stack is proportional to the number of operands in the RPN expression.

Overall, the space complexity is O(n).

class Solution {
public:
    int evalRPN(vector<string>& tokens) {
        stack<int> st;

        auto isSign = [](string token) {
            return (token == "+" || token == "-" || token == "*" || token == "/");
        };
        for(auto token : tokens){
            if(isSign(token)){
                int num2 = st.top();
                st.pop();
                int num1 = st.top();
                st.pop();
                if(token == "+"){
                    st.push(num1 + num2);
                }
                else if(token == "-"){
                    st.push(num1 - num2);
                }
                else if(token == "*"){
                    st.push(num1 * num2);
                }
                else {
                    st.push(num1 / num2);
                }
                
            }
            else {
                int num = stoi(token);
                st.push(num);
            }
                
        }
        return st.top();
    }    
};
