## [1074. Number of Submatrices That Sum to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-submatrices-that-sum-to-target/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-28)


# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem is finding the number of submatrices in a given matrix whose sum is equal to a target value. 

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
**Initialized Variables :**
   - `jawab`: A static variable to store the final result.
   - `r`: Number of rows in the matrix.
   - `c`: Number of columns in the matrix.
   - `m`: A HashMap to store cumulative sum frequencies.

**Calculated Cumulative Sums :**
   - Iterated over each row in the matrix and calculated cumulative sums for each element in that row. This is done to efficiently compute the sum of submatrices.

**Iterated Over Column Combinations :**
   - Used two nested loops to iterate over all possible combinations of columns (ic and j).
   - For each column combination, initialized the HashMap (`m`) to store cumulative sum frequencies.

**Calculate Cumulative Sums for Submatrices :**
   - Iterated over each row to calculate the cumulative sum (`jor`) for submatrices.
   - Adjusted the cumulative sum if `ic` is greater than 0 (not the first column).

**Updated Result and HashMap :**
   - Updated the result (`jawab`) by adding the frequency of the target cumulative sum found in the HashMap.
   - Updated the HashMap with the current cumulative sum and its frequency.

**Return Result :**
   - Returned the final result, which represents the count of submatrices with the target sum.

My approach leverages cumulative sums and dynamic programming to efficiently count submatrices with a target sum, making it an optimized solution.

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(r * c^2)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$r$ : number of rows in the matrix

$c$ : number of columns in the matrix
- Space complexity : $O(c)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
