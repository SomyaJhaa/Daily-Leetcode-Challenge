## [1207. Unique Number of Occurrences](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-17)

**Intuition:**

The problem requires determining whether the occurrences of each unique element in the given array are unique. To solve this, we can count the occurrences of each element using an unordered_map and then check if the counts themselves are unique using an unordered_set.

**Approach:**

1. Initialize an unordered_map named `counts` to store the count of occurrences of each unique element in the array.

2. Iterate through the given array, updating the counts in the `counts` unordered_map.

    ```cpp
    for (int i : arr) {
        counts[i]++;
    }
    ```

3. Create an unordered_set named `occurrenceSet` to store the counts of occurrences.

4. Iterate through the values in the `counts` unordered_map and check for uniqueness.

    ```cpp
    for (const auto& kv : counts) {
        // If the count is already present in the unordered_set, return false.
        if (occurrenceSet.count(kv.second)) {
            return false;
        }
        // Otherwise, add the count to the unordered_set.
        occurrenceSet.insert(kv.second);
    }
    ```

5. If the loop completes without returning false, it means all counts are unique, so return true.

This approach ensures that both the elements and their counts are considered, and the final result indicates whether the counts of occurrences are unique for each unique element in the array.


**Time Complexity:**

Let \(n\) be the length of the input array.

1. The loop that iterates through the array to update the counts in the unordered_map takes O(n) time.

2. The second loop iterates through the values in the unordered_map, which has a maximum size of \(n\) in the worst case. Therefore, this loop also takes O(n) time.

The overall time complexity of the code is O(n).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity is determined by the space used for the unordered_map (`counts`) and the unordered_set (`occurrenceSet`).

1. The unordered_map (`counts`) can have at most \(n\) unique elements in the worst case, each requiring constant space for its count. Therefore, the space complexity for the unordered_map is O(n).

2. The unordered_set (`occurrenceSet`) can also have at most \(n\) unique counts in the worst case, each requiring constant space. Therefore, the space complexity for the unordered_set is O(n).

The overall space complexity of the code is O(n).





# Code
```

class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> counts;

        // Iterating through the array and updating the counts in the unordered_map.
        for (int i : arr) {
            counts[i]++;
        }

        // Creating an unordered_set to store the counts of occurrences.
        unordered_set<int> occurrenceSet;

        // Iterating through the values in the unordered_map and checking for uniqueness.
        for (const auto& kv : counts) {
            // If the count is already present in the unordered_set, returning false.
            if (occurrenceSet.count(kv.second)) {
                return false;
            }
            // Otherwise, adding the count to the unordered_set.
            occurrenceSet.insert(kv.second);
        }

        // If the loop completes without returning false, returning true.
        return true;
    }
};
