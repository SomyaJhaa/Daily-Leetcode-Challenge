## 1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree


# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The goal is to find the number of pseudo-palindromic paths in a binary tree. A pseudo-palindromic path is a path where the frequency of each digit in the path is such that at most one digit has an odd frequency, making it possible to form a palindrome.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
##### TreeNode Class :
   - My code starts with the definition of a `TreeNode` class representing a node in the binary tree.

##### Main Solution Class :
   - The `Solution` class contains a static variable `jawab` to store the final result.

   - The `pseudoPalindromicPaths` method initialized the result variable and calls the helper method to traverse the tree and find paths.

##### Helper Method :
   - The `helper` method is my recursive function that traversed the binary tree.
   
   - For each node encountered :
     - It XORs the current node's value with the bitmask `rasta`.
     - If the node is a leaf node :
       - It checked if the updated bitmask has at most one set bit, indicating a pseudo-palindromic path.
       - If true, incremented the result variable `jawab`.
     - Recursively called itself for the left and right children, updating the bitmask accordingly.

##### Bitmask :
   - The bitmask `rasta` is used to keep track of the frequency of digits encountered in the path.
   
   - XOR operation is used to toggle the bit corresponding to the current node's value.

   - The expression `((rasta - 1) & rasta) == 0` checks if the updated bitmask has at most one set bit, ensuring the pseudo-palindromic property.

##### Result :
   - The final result is the count of pseudo-palindromic paths, stored in the `jawab` variable.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments
Keep Solving.:)

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(N)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$N$ : number of nodes in the binary tree, as each node is visited once.
- Space complexity : $O(H)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$H$ : height of the binary tree, due to the recursion stack
