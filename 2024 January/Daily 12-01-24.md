## [1704. Determine if String Halves Are Alike](https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-string-halves-are-alike/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-12)


**Intuition:**
The problem asks to split a given string into two equal halves and check if the number of vowels in the first half is equal to the number of vowels in the second half. To solve this, the code converts the entire string to lowercase and counts the number of vowels in each half.

**Approach:**
1. Convert the entire string to lowercase using `transform`.
2. Initialize a variable `vowel` to 0 to count the number of vowels.
3. Iterate over the first half of the string and increment the `vowel` count for each vowel encountered.
4. Iterate over the second half of the string and decrement the `vowel` count for each vowel encountered.
5. Return `true` if the final `vowel` count is 0 (indicating an equal number of vowels in both halves), otherwise return `false`.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the code is O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. The loop iterates through each character in the first and second halves of the string.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) since the additional space used (variable `vowel`) is constant regardless of the size of the input string. The `transform` function does not incur additional space complexity in this case.


# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool halvesAreAlike(string s) {
        transform(s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), ::tolower);
        int vowel = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < s.size()/2; i++){
            if(s[i] == 'a' || s[i] == 'e' || s[i] == 'i' || s[i] == 'o' || s[i] == 'u')
            vowel++;
        }
        for(int i= s.size()/2; i<s.size(); i++){
            if(s[i] == 'a' || s[i] == 'e' || s[i] == 'i' || s[i] == 'o' || s[i] == 'u')
           vowel--;
        }
        return vowel == 0;
    }
};
