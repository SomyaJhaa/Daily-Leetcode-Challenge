## [938. Range Sum of BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-08)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem asks for the sum of values of all nodes in a binary search tree (BST) within a given range [low, high]. Since it's a BST, we can utilize its properties to efficiently find the nodes within the specified range.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Traverse the BST using a recursive approach.
- At each node, check if its value is within the range [low, high].
- - If the value is less than low, explore only the right subtree (as all nodes in the left subtree will also be less than low).
- - If the value is greater than high, explore only the left subtree (as all nodes in the right subtree will also be greater than high).
- - If the value is within the range, include it in the sum.
Recursively repeat the process for both the left and right subtrees.
- Return the sum.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(h)$$ -->

# Code
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}

class Solution {
public:
    int rangeSumBST(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
        if(root == nullptr) return 0;
        if(root -> val < low) return rangeSumBST(root -> right, low, high);
        if(root -> val > high) return rangeSumBST(root -> left, low, high);
        return root -> val + rangeSumBST(root -> left, low, high) + rangeSumBST(root -> right, low, high);
    }
