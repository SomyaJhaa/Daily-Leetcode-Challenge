## 576. Out of Boundary Paths


# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
This problem involves finding the number of paths a ball can take to move out of a grid within a given number of moves. My goal is to optimize the solution using dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
I have utilized dynamic programming approach with memoization to efficiently calculate the number of paths. A recursive helper function is defined to explore all possible moves, and a 3D memoization array is used to store and retrieve previously computed results.

#### Recursive Helper Function

My recursive function is responsible for calculating the number of paths from a given cell with a specified number of remaining moves. Key points of the recursive function include:
- Base cases : Handled scenarios where the ball moves outside the grid or runs out of moves.
- Memoization : Stored and retrieved results using a 3D array to avoid redundant calculations.
- Recursive step : Explored all possible moves (up, down, left, right) and sum up the results with modulo to prevent integer overflow.

#### Code Explanation
My Java code provided implements the described approach. The `findPaths` function initializes the memoization array and calls the recursive helper function. The `helper` function handles the recursive calculations and memoization.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(m * n * maxMove)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$m$ :  number of rows in the grid
$n$ :  number of columns in the grid
$maxMove$ :  maximum number of moves allowed
- Space complexity :  $O(m * n * (1+maxMove))$ ~  $O(m * n * maxMove)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {

    // Modulo value for the result
    static int mod = 1_000_000_007;

    // Main function to find paths
    public int findPaths(int m, int n, int maxMove, int startRow, int startColumn) {
        
        // Creating 3D array to store previously calculated results
        Integer[][][] h = new Integer[1 + maxMove][m][n];
        return helper(startRow, startColumn, maxMove, m, n, h);
    }

    // Helper function for recursive calculations
    static int helper(int r, int c, int max, int m, int n, Integer[][][] h) {
        // Base case: if the cell is outside the grid, count it as a path
        if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r == m || c == n) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        // Base case: if the maximum moves are exhausted, no more paths
        if (max == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // If the result for the current state is already calculated, returning it
        if (h[max][r][c] != null) {
            return h[max][r][c];
        }

        // Recursively calculating of paths by moving in all possible directions
        h[max][r][c] = (int) ((
                (helper(r, c + 1, max - 1, m, n, h)) * 1L +
                helper(r, c - 1, max - 1, m, n, h) +
                helper(r + 1, c, max - 1, m, n, h) +
                helper(r - 1, c, max - 1, m, n, h)
        ) % mod);

        // Storing the calculated result and return it
        return h[max][r][c];
    }
}
