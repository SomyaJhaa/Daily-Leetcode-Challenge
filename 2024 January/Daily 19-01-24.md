## [931. Minimum Falling Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-19)


**Intuition:**

The provided code uses dynamic programming to find the minimum sum of a falling path through the given matrix. The algorithm starts from the top row and calculates the minimum sum for each element in the subsequent rows. The idea is to maintain a memoization table (`memo`) to store intermediate results and efficiently calculate the minimum sum for each position in the matrix.

1. Initialize a memoization table (`memo`) of size `n x n`, where `n` is the size of the matrix. The memo table is used to store the minimum sum of falling paths for each element in the matrix.

2. Iterate through the matrix starting from the second row (`i = 1`), and for each element at position `(i, j)`, calculate the minimum sum by considering the three possible paths from the previous row:
   - From directly above: `(i - 1, j)`
   - Diagonally left above: `(i - 1, j - 1)`
   - Diagonally right above: `(i - 1, j + 1)`
   
   The minimum sum for the current element is the sum of the current element's value and the minimum of the three possible paths.

3. Update the memo table with the calculated minimum sum for each element.

4. After iterating through the entire matrix, find the minimum value in the last row of the memo table. This represents the minimum sum of a falling path through the matrix.

5. Return the minimum sum as the result.

**Time Complexity:**
- The algorithm iterates through each element in the matrix once, performing constant time operations for each element. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the size of the matrix.

**Space Complexity:**
- The memoization table (`memo`) is used to store intermediate results for each element in the matrix. The space complexity is O(n^2) to store the memo table.

In summary, the provided code efficiently calculates the minimum sum of a falling path through the matrix using dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n^2).

# Code
```

class Solution {
public:
    int minFallingPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        int m = matrix[0].size();

        // Create a memoization table to store intermediate results
        vector<vector<long long>> memo(n, vector<long long>(m, LLONG_MAX));

        // Initialize the first row of the memo table
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            memo[0][j] = matrix[0][j];
        }

        // Fill the memo table bottom-up
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                memo[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + min({memo[i - 1][j], (j > 0) ? memo[i - 1][j - 1] : LLONG_MAX, (j < m - 1) ? memo[i - 1][j + 1] : LLONG_MAX});
            }
        }

        // Find the minimum value in the last row of the memo table
        return static_cast<int>(*min_element(memo[n - 1].begin(), memo[n - 1].end()));
    }
};
