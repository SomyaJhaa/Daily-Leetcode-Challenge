# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The idea is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of arithmetic subsequences ending at each index in the array. The dynamic programming approach is based on iterating through pairs of indices (i, j) and considering the difference between the elements at those indices. The number of subsequences with the same difference is updated based on the previous counts.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Initialize a variable ans to store the total count of arithmetic subsequences.
- Create a vector of unordered maps named dp, where dp[i][diff] represents the number of arithmetic subsequences ending at index i with a common difference diff.
- Iterate through each element in the array:
- - For each pair of indices j and i (where j is less than i), calculate the difference diff between nums[i] and nums[j].
- - Update dp[i][diff] by adding the count of subsequences ending at index j with the common difference diff and incrementing by 1.
- - Update the total count of arithmetic subsequences (ans) by adding the count of subsequences ending at index j with the common difference diff.
- Return the final count of arithmetic subsequences (ans).
# Code Explanation:
- The code uses nested loops to iterate through pairs of indices, calculating the difference and updating the counts.
- The dp vector of unordered maps is utilized to store the counts for each common difference at each index.
- The final answer is the accumulated count of all arithmetic subsequences.
 # Example
Let's take an example: nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].

- Initialize ans = 0.
- Iterate through the array:
- - For i = 1, calculate differences with previous indices (j = 0):
- - - diff = 2, update dp[1][2] += dp[0][2] + 1 and ans += dp[0][2].
- - For i = 2, calculate differences with previous indices (j = 0, 1):
- - - diff = 2, update dp[2][2] += dp[1][2] + 1 and ans += dp[1][2].
- - - diff = 4, update dp[2][4] += dp[1][4] + 1 and ans += dp[1][4].
- - Continue this process for the remaining indices.
- The final ans will contain the total count of arithmetic subsequences.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$ O(n^2) $$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $$ O(n^2) $$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
#define l1 long long int
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArithmeticSlices(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int ans = 0;
        vector<unordered_map<l1 , int>> dp(n); //dp[i][d]
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                l1 diff = (l1) nums[i] - nums[j];

                dp[i][diff] += dp[j][diff] + 1;
                ans += dp[j][diff];
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
