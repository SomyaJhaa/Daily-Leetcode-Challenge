## [1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-25)


# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
This problem aims to find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between two given strings, `text1` and `text2`. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. The code uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the length of the LCS.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
**Dynamic Programming Array (dp) :**
   - Created a 2D array `dp` of dimensions `(1 + text1.length()) x (1 + text2.length())` to store the lengths of common subsequences for different prefixes of the input strings.
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS for the prefixes of `text1` up to index `i-1` and `text2` up to index `j-1`.

**Nested Loop Iteration :**
   - Iterated through each character in `text1` (using index `i`).
   - For each character in `text1`, iterated through each character in `text2` (using index `j`).
   
**Character Comparison :**
   - If the characters at the current positions (i, j) in both strings are equal:
      - Incremented the length of the common subsequence by 1: `dp[i + 1][j + 1] = 1 + dp[i][j]`.
   - If the characters are not equal:
      - Choosed the maximum length from the previous positions:
        `dp[i + 1][j + 1] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1])`.

**Result :**
   - The value at the bottom-right corner of the array (`dp[text1.length()][text2.length()]`) contains the length of the longest common subsequence.

**Return :**
   - Returned the length of the LCS as the final result.

My dynamic programming approach efficiently breaks down the problem into subproblems, avoiding redundant computations and providing an optimal solution for finding the length of the longest common subsequence.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments

# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(a*b)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$a$ : length of string 'text1'

$b$ : length of string 'text2'
- Space complexity : $O(a*b)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```
class Solution {
    
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        
        // Creating a 2D array to store the length of common subsequences
        int[][] dp = new int[1 + text1.length()][1 + text2.length()];

        // Iterating through each character in text1
        for (int i = 0; i < text1.length(); i++) {
            // Iterating through each character in text2
            for (int j = 0; j < text2.length(); j++) {
                // Checking if the characters at the current positions are equal
                if (text1.charAt(i) == text2.charAt(j)) {
                    // If equal, extending the common subsequence length by 1
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = 1 + dp[i][j];
                } else {
                    // If not equal, choosing the maximum length from the previous positions
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // The value at the bottom-right corner of the array contains the length of the longest common subsequence
        return dp[text1.length()][text2.length()];
    }
}
