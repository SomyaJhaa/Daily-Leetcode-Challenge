## [198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-21)


### Top-Down (Code 1):

**Intuition:**
The top-down approach uses recursion with memoization to solve the problem. The idea is to calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed starting from the first house (`nums[0]`) and moving forward. At each house, the robber has two choices: rob the current house or skip it.

**Approach:**
1. Create a recursive function `robHelper` that takes the current house index as a parameter.
2. In the `robHelper` function, check if the current house index is valid.
3. If the current house index is not valid, return 0 (no money to rob).
4. If the result for the current index is already memoized, return the memoized result.
5. Calculate the maximum amount of money that can be robbed starting from the current house.
6. The maximum amount is the maximum of:
   - Robbing the current house and recursively moving to the next-to-next house (`robHelper(index + 2)`).
   - Skipping the current house and recursively moving to the next house (`robHelper(index + 1)`).
7. Memoize the result for the current index and return the maximum amount.

### Bottom-Up (Code 2):

**Intuition:**
The bottom-up approach uses dynamic programming to solve the problem iteratively. It builds the solution from the smallest subproblem (robbery of a single house) to the final problem (robbery of all houses). It maintains an array `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to house `i`.

**Approach:**
1. Create a vector `dp` of size `n` to store the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to each house.
2. Initialize `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` based on the money in the first two houses.
3. Iterate from the third house to the last house and update `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation: `dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + nums[i], dp[i-1])`.
4. The final result is stored in `dp[n-1]`.

### Space Optimization (Code 3):

**Intuition:**
The space-optimized version reduces the space complexity by using only two variables (`prev2` and `prev1`) to store the maximum amounts for the previous two houses. This is possible because the recurrence relation only depends on the results of the last two houses.

**Approach:**
1. Initialize `prev2` and `prev1` based on the money in the first two houses.
2. Iterate from the third house to the last house and update `prev2` and `prev1` accordingly.
3. The final result is stored in `prev1`.

These three approaches solve the house robbery problem by considering different strategies: top-down recursion with memoization, bottom-up dynamic programming, and a space-optimized version with reduced space complexity. Each approach aims to maximize the total amount of money that can be robbed without alerting the police.

### Top-Down (Code 1):

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the top-down approach is O(n), where n is the number of houses. This is because each recursive call branches into two further calls, leading to an exponential number of recursive calls. However, with memoization, the actual time complexity is reduced to O(n), as each subproblem is solved only once.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(n) due to the memoization array, which stores the results of subproblems.

### Bottom-Up (Code 2):

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the bottom-up approach is O(n), where n is the number of houses. This is because the approach iterates through all houses once, calculating the maximum amount of money that can be robbed at each step.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(n) as well, as it uses an additional array `dp` of size n to store the maximum amounts.

### Space Optimization (Code 3):

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity is O(n), as the approach iterates through all houses once.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) since it uses only two variables (`prev2` and `prev1`) to store the results for the previous two houses. The space is constant and does not depend on the input size.

These complexities represent the efficiency of each approach in terms of time and space requirements.



# Code
```

**Top-Down(Code 1)**
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> dp;
    int maxRobbery(int i, vector<int>& nums){
        if(i < 0) return 0;

        if(dp[i] != -1) return dp[i];

        int ans = max(nums[i] + maxRobbery(i-2, nums), maxRobbery(i-1, nums));
        return dp[i] = ans;
    }
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        dp = vector<int>(n+1, -1);
        return maxRobbery(n-1, nums);
    }
};

**Bootom-Up(Code 2)**

class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp = vector<int>(n+1, 0);
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        if(n ==1) return dp[0];

        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        for(int i=2; i<n; i++){
            dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1]);
        }
        return dp[n-1];
    }
};

**Space optimization(Code 3)**
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        // vector<int> dp = vector<int>(n+1, 0);
        int prev2 = nums[0];
        // dp[0] = nums[0];
        if(n ==1) return prev2;

        int prev1 = max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        for(int i=2; i<n; i++){
            int cur = max(nums[i] + prev2, prev1);
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = cur;
        }
        return prev1;
    }
};
